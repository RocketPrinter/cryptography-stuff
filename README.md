Pseudorandom random number generated which uses the RSA function, made for a class.

# ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
In theory it should be crytographically secure but it's not tested. The RSA function has one bit security which means you can leak at most one bit from each iteration without allowing an attacker to compromise the generator.
